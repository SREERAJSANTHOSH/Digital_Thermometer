## 📝 About

Increase in population,the scenario of cleanliness with respect to garbage management is degrading tremendously.In a city there are many public where we see that garbage
bins are placed but are overflowing. This creates an unhygienic condition in nearbysurrounding. Also create ugliness and spread some serious diseases, at the same time
the bad smell is also spread and it also degrades the valuation of the area.

To avoid such situations we come up with a project called ”SMART DUSTBIN”which is a NodeMCU based garbage and waste collection bin. The main aim of this prototype that 
has features like automatic lid mechanism and garbage level sensing.
## 🚀 Features

- 🌡️ Sensor-based waste level detection
- 🔄 Automated lid opening/closing
- 📊 Real-time data tracking
- 📱 Mobile app integration
- 💡 Energy-efficient design
